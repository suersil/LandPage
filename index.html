                    <h3>Harry Potter - Best Seller</h3>
                    <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The
                        novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and
                        Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main
                        story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become
                        immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all
                        wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>

                    <h3>Take The Risk - Ben Carson</h3>
                    <p>No risk, pay the cost. Know risk, reap the rewards. In our risk-avoidance culture, we place a
                        high premium on safety. We insure our vacations. We check crash tests on cars. We extend the
                        warranties on our appliances. But by insulating ourselves from the unknown--the risks of
                        life--we miss the great adventure of living our lives to their full potential.</p>
                        <p>By avoiding risk, are you also avoiding the full potential of your life?</p>
